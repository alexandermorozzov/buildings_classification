- [merging_gdfs_for_fit.ipynb](https://github.com/alexandermorozzov/buildings_classification/blob/main/merging_gdfs_for_fit.ipynb) - merging all GeoDataFrames for model fittng and further training;
- [tashkent.ipynb](https://github.com/alexandermorozzov/buildings_classification/blob/main/tashkent.ipynb) - preprocess data for Toshkent city (Uzbekistan) and prediction of residential/non-residential type of buildings.
